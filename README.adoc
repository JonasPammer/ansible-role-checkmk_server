[[variables::component_config]]
=== Role Variables used to configure CheckMk's components

OMD is a system that integrates multiple software components into a monitoring system.
In so doing, some components are optional, and for some there are alternatives or different operational settings.
https://docs.checkmk.com/latest/en/omd_basics.html#omdconfig[All of this]
can be comfortably configured with these variables (actually issues `omd config`).

#Note that the CheckMk site must temporarily be stopped if a change is required.#

The most important are:

CORE::
Selection of the monitoring core.
MKEVENTD::
Activates the Checkmk Event Console, with which the syslog messages, SNMP-Traps and other events can be processed
MKNOTIFYD::
Enterprise Editions: Activates the notification spooler.
AUTOSTART::
This is primarily of interest for test installations that should not normally start by themselves.
LIVESTATUS_TCP::
Allows external access to the status data for this site.
A distributed monitoring can be constructed with this.
The status of this instance can be incorporated into the central instance.
Please only activate it in a secure network.

[[public_vars]]
== üìú Facts/Variables defined by this role

Each variable listed in this section
is dynamically defined when executing this role (and can only be overwritten using `ansible.builtin.set_facts`) _and_
is meant to be used not just internally.


[[dependencies]]
== üë´ Dependencies
// A list of other roles should go here,
// plus any details in regard to parameters that may need to be set for other roles,
// or variables that are used from other roles.



[[example_playbooks]]
== üìö Example Playbook Usages
// Including examples of how to use this role in a playbook for common scenarios is always nice for users.

[NOTE]
====
This role is part of https://github.com/JonasPammer/ansible-roles[

In CI, this is done in `molecule/default/prepare.yml`
which sources its soft dependencies from `requirements.yml`:
