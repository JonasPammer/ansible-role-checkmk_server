An Ansible role for installing
https://checkmk.com/product/raw-edition[CheckMK RAW edition],
setting up a site and configuring basic CheckMk functionality parameters.

This role does *not*

* configure NTP (recommended by CheckMk)
* configure a SMTP-Server
* support SUSE Linux Enterprise Server (pull request welcome if requested, though)

[[requirements]]
== üìå Requirements
// Any prerequisites that may not be covered by this role or Ansible itself should be mentioned here.
The Ansible User needs to be able to `become`.


The https://galaxy.ansible.com/community/general[`community.general` collection]
must be installed on the Ansible controller.


[[variables]]
== üìú Role Variables
// A description of the settable variables for this role should go here
// and any variables that can/should be set via parameters to the role.
// Any variables that are read from other roles and/or the global scope (ie. hostvars, group vars, etc.)
// should be mentioned here as well.

[source,yaml]
----
checkmk_site_url: "http://localhost/{{ checkmk_server_site }}"
----
URL resolving to the CheckMk site. Must not end with an `/`.

[source,yaml]
----
checkmk_server_site: "main"
----
Name of OMD "site" to create;
this is often shown as `my-site` in the CheckMK documentation examples.

[source,yaml]
----
checkmk_server_download_checksum: [OS-specific, see /defaults directory]
checkmk_server_version: "2.0.0p27"
----
Version of CheckMK RAW edition to install.

The default value of these variables is semi-automatically being updated
to the latest non-beta CheckMk RAW v2 Release through the help of a CI Workflow
and some accompanying python scripts which can be found in `__scripts`.

Every said update is accompanied with a new release of at least a minor version bump.
See <<changelog>> for an overview.

[NOTE]
Even though you could pin the version of this role to get a pinned version of checkmk,
I recommend that you install the latest version of this role and
change these variables yourself instead as I do not backport
actual patches made to this role into older versions
(if that is even possible).

[[variables--component_config]]
=== Role Variables used to configure CheckMk's components

OMD is a system that integrates multiple software components into a monitoring system.
In so doing, some components are optional, and for some there are alternatives or different operational settings.
https://docs.checkmk.com/latest/en/omd_basics.html#omdconfig[All of this]
can be comfortably configured with these variables (actually issues `omd config`).

#Note that the CheckMk site must temporarily be stopped if a change is required.#

The most important are:

CORE::
Selection of the monitoring core.
MKEVENTD::
Activates the Checkmk Event Console, with which the syslog messages, SNMP-Traps and other events can be processed
MKNOTIFYD::
Enterprise Editions: Activates the notification spooler.
AUTOSTART::
This is primarily of interest for test installations that should not normally start by themselves.
LIVESTATUS_TCP::
Allows external access to the status data for this site.
A distributed monitoring can be constructed with this.
The status of this instance can be incorporated into the central instance.
Please only activate it in a secure network.

[[public_vars]]
== üìú Facts/Variables defined by this role

Each variable listed in this section
is dynamically defined when executing this role (and can only be overwritten using `ansible.builtin.set_facts`) _and_
is meant to be used not just internally.


[[dependencies]]
== üë´ Dependencies
// A list of other roles should go here,
// plus any details in regard to parameters that may need to be set for other roles,
// or variables that are used from other roles.

apache__service::
Overwrites this role's version of the default for `checkmk_apache_service`


[[example_playbooks]]
== üìö Example Playbook Usages
// Including examples of how to use this role in a playbook for common scenarios is always nice for users.

[NOTE]
====
This role is part of https://github.com/JonasPammer/ansible-roles[
many compatible purpose-specific roles of mine].

The machine needs to be prepared.
In CI, this is done in `molecule/default/prepare.yml`
which sources its soft dependencies from `requirements.yml`:
